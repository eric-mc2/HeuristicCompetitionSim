Description: This this code was developed to explore the implications of a theory of decision making developed by Michael Cowan. Michael is researching people's motivations for participating in political movements, especially insurgencies, and for adopting specific political ideologies. The premise is that political organizations compete for membership by creating narratives that are contrastingly simple and truthful. This package exposes one function, 'simulate', which runs the ABM.
